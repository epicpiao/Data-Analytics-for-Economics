Also, some outliers might indicate problems with how data was captured or recorded.\n",

The analysis you've performed indicates that a video's engagement level is strongly correlated with its claim status. There's no reason to believe that any of the values in the TikTok data are erroneously captured, and they align with expectation of how social media works: a very small proportion of videos get super high engagement levels. That's the nature of viral content.\n",

The definition of an outlier can change based on the details of your project, and it helps to have domain expertise to decide a threshold. You've learned that a common way to determine outliers in a normal distribution is to calculate the interquartile range (IQR) and set a threshold that is 1.5 * IQR above the 3rd quartile.\n",

This results in a threshold that is, in this case, much lower than it would be if you used the 3rd quartile.\n",
