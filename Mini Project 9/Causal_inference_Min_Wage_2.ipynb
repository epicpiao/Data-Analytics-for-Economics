    "# Replication Study: Minimum Wages and Fast-Food Employment (Card & Krueger, 1994)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "This notebook aims to replicate the core analysis presented in the seminal paper by David Card and Alan B. Krueger: \"Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania\" (American Economic Review, 1994). This study is a classic example of using a natural experiment and the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) methodology to estimate causal effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "*   **The Policy Change:** On April 1, 1992, the state of New Jersey (NJ) increased its minimum hourly wage from $4.25 to $5.05.\n",
    "*   **The \"Control\" Group:** Neighboring eastern Pennsylvania (PA) did not change its minimum wage during this period, keeping it at $4.25.\n",
    "*   **The Data:** Card and Krueger collected data from approximately 410 fast-food restaurants (Burger King, KFC, Roy Rogers, Wendy's) in NJ and eastern PA both *before* the wage increase (February-March 1992) and *after* the increase (November-December 1992).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question:**\n",
    "What is the effect of a minimum wage increase on employment levels in the fast-food industry? The standard competitive labor market model predicts that an increase in the minimum wage (if binding) should lead to a decrease in employment. Card and Krueger tested this prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology: Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**\n",
    "The DiD strategy compares the change in the outcome variable (employment) in the \"treatment\" group (NJ) before and after the policy change to the change in the outcome variable in the \"control\" group (PA) over the same time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Treatment Group:** New Jersey restaurants (received the minimum wage increase).\n",
    "*   **Control Group:** Pennsylvania restaurants (did not receive the increase).\n",
    "*   **Outcome Variable:** Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) employment.\n",
    "*   **DiD Estimate =** (Avg Employment<sub>NJ, After</sub> - Avg Employment<sub>NJ, Before</sub>) - (Avg Employment<sub>PA, After</sub> - Avg Employment<sub>PA, Before</sub>)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Identifying Assumption: Parallel Trends**\n",
    "The core assumption of DiD is that, in the *absence* of the minimum wage increase in NJ, the employment trends in NJ and PA fast-food restaurants would have been parallel. The change observed in PA is used as a counterfactual for what would have happened in NJ without the policy change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source:**\n",
    "The analysis uses the publicly available dataset provided by Professor David Card."

    "## 8. Conclusion and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performed a replication of the key analyses from Card and Krueger's (1994) study on the employment effects of minimum wage increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary of Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Wage Effects:** The visualization of starting wage distributions confirmed that the New Jersey minimum wage increase was binding. After the policy change, there was a pronounced spike in NJ starting wages at the new $5.05 minimum, a pattern not observed in Pennsylvania. This validates the setup for the natural experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Employment Effects (Difference-in-Differences):**\n",
    "    *   **Group Means Comparison:** The simple comparison of average FTE changes between NJ and PA (using the balanced panel) yielded a DiD estimate of approximately **`[Insert Value from 'Difference (NJ - PA)' for 'DiD Estimate (Balanced Means)']`** FTEs per restaurant (SE: `[Insert Value from 'Difference (NJ - PA)' for 'SE of DiD Estimate (Balanced Means)']`). This suggests that employment in NJ *increased* relative to PA after the minimum wage hike.\n",
    "    *   **Regression Analysis:** The OLS regression model, controlling for restaurant chain and ownership status, estimated the DiD effect (the coefficient for being in NJ) to be **`[Insert Value from did_coefficient_reg]`** (SE: `[Insert Value from did_se_reg]`, p-value: `[Insert Value from did_pvalue_reg]`). This regression-adjusted estimate also points towards a positive relative change in employment in NJ, although its statistical significance in this specific basic OLS model is `[State significance based on p-value, e.g., 'borderline', 'not significant at the 5% level', 'significant at the 10% level']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Interpretation:**\n",
    "The results from this replication align with the main conclusion of Card and Krueger's original paper: there is **no evidence** that the increase in New Jersey's minimum wage led to a decrease in employment in the fast-food industry. Both the simple DiD calculation and the regression-adjusted estimate suggest that employment in New Jersey actually *grew* slightly relative to Pennsylvania during the period studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats:**\n",
    "*   The basic OLS model used here might differ slightly from weighted least squares or other specifications used in the original paper, potentially leading to small differences in estimates and standard errors.\n",
    "*   As with any DiD study, the validity rests on the parallel trends assumption – that NJ and PA would have followed similar employment paths in the absence of the policy change.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study was highly influential, challenging conventional wisdom and sparking decades of further research and debate on the labor market impacts of minimum wages.\n",
    "\n",
